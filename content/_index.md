# Hello.

I am a Computer Science PhD student and Researcher focusing on **Formal Methods**, **Programming Languages**, and **Cybersecurity**.

My work primarily bridges the gap between rigorous theory and practical systems security. I am currently investigating **Copland**, a DSL for remote attestation, formal methods, and language design.

### Current Status
* **Research:** 
  + Copland Infrastructure and Applications
    + Copland Type System, Protocol Synthesis
  + Attestation Protocols
    + Attestation for Robust *Verified* Workflows
    + The **CARE Pipeline** (Copland-Assisted Repair Engine) and the **HEAL Framework**.
* **Teaching:** 
  + Fall 2025 - Teaching Assistant for [**EECS 755: Software Modeling and Analysis**](https://perry.alexander.name/eecs755/)
    * Lectured on **Verified Sorting Algorithms**, **Ltac & Hint Database Automation**, and **Dependent Types** in **Rocq**
* **Building:** 
  + Personal Projects: **OCaml** and **Rust**.
  + Academic Pursuits: **Rocq**, **OCaml**, and **Verus**
