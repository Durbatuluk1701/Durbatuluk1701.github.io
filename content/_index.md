# Hello.

I am a Computer Science PhD student and Researcher focusing on **Formal Methods**, **Programming Languages**, and **Cybersecurity**.

My work primarily bridges the gap between rigorous theory and practical systems security. I am currently investigating **Copland**, a DSL for remote attestation, and how to build verifiable control loops for non-deterministic systems (like LLMs).

### Current Status
* **Researching:** The **CARE Pipeline** (Copland-Assisted Repair Engine) and the **HEAL Framework**.
* **Teaching:** Instructor for *Formal Methods and Proving*.
* **Building:** Tooling in **OCaml** and **Rust**.
